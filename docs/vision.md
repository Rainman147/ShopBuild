# Hyperion Manufacturing — Lights-Out Cell Vision

## Executive Summary

Design and implement a proof-of-concept fully-automated machining cell capable of:
- 24/7 unmanned operation
- Mixed part production from raw stock to finished goods
- Automated quality control and part routing
- Tool lifecycle management
- Minimal human intervention

## Core Requirements

### Production Capability
- Target: 50-100 parts/day mixed production
- Part envelope: 200mm × 200mm × 150mm max
- Materials: Aluminum, steel, titanium
- Tolerance: ±0.02mm typical, ±0.005mm critical features

### Automation Level
- **Level 4**: Fully automated with exception handling
- Human intervention only for:
  - Raw material loading (weekly)
  - Tool changes (monthly)
  - Maintenance (scheduled)
  - Exception handling

### Key Performance Indicators
- Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE): >85%
- First-pass yield: >95%
- Mean time between failures (MTBF): >168 hours
- Setup time: <15 minutes

## System Architecture

### Core Components
1. **DN Solutions DVF 6500** - Primary machining center
2. **KUKA Robot** - Material handling and loading
3. **Fastems-style tower** - Raw material and WIP storage
4. **CMM Station** - Automated quality control
5. **Tool room automation** - Tool management and presetting

### Integration Standards
- **OPC-UA** for machine communication
- **ROS 2** for robot control and coordination
- **MTConnect** for machine monitoring
- **REST APIs** for higher-level orchestration

## Success Criteria

### Technical
- [ ] Demonstrate 72-hour unmanned operation
- [ ] Process 3 different part families without manual intervention
- [ ] Achieve target OEE and quality metrics
- [ ] Complete integration with existing MES/ERP systems

### Business
- [ ] ROI payback period <3 years
- [ ] Scalable architecture for additional cells
- [ ] Knowledge base for future automation projects
- [ ] Vendor partnership agreements established

## Timeline

### Phase 1: Research & Design (Weeks 1-4)
- Complete component selection and BOM
- Finalize cell layout and material flow
- Develop integration architecture

### Phase 2: Procurement & Setup (Weeks 5-16)
- Order equipment and components
- Prepare facility and utilities
- Begin software development

### Phase 3: Integration & Testing (Weeks 17-24)
- Install and commission equipment
- Integrate control systems
- Perform validation testing

### Phase 4: Production Validation (Weeks 25-28)
- Run production trials
- Optimize processes
- Document lessons learned

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Equipment integration failures**: Prototype key interfaces early
- **Cycle time assumptions**: Model and simulate before procurement
- **Quality system reliability**: Design redundant measurement strategies

### Business Risks
- **Vendor delays**: Maintain alternative supplier relationships
- **Cost overruns**: Implement phased procurement with decision gates
- **Skills gap**: Begin training programs in parallel with equipment delivery

## Next Steps

1. Complete detailed component research and BOM finalization
2. Develop detailed CAD layout with collision analysis
3. Create detailed project timeline with critical path analysis
4. Begin vendor negotiations and quote collection
